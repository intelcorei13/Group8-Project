## Overview
This project builds an interactive **Streamlit** web app to predict **loan approval** using supervised learning.  
We compare a **Decision Tree Classifier** and **Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB)**, and provide clear visualizations, model metrics, and a quick ‚Äúwhat-if‚Äù prediction page.  

The app also demonstrates:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with charts and distributions  
- Feature engineering (including EMI creation)  
- Preprocessing with encoding & scaling  
- Model training and threshold tuning  
- Cross-validation (10-fold) for robust evaluation  
- Side-by-side comparison of models with feature importance

## Features
- **Dataset Page** ‚Äî View dataset  
- **EDA Page** ‚Äî Explore distributions, correlations, and relationships  
- **Classification: Decision Tree** ‚Äî Train, tune thresholds, view feature importance  
- **Classification: Naive Bayes** ‚Äî Train with scaled features, view importance via permutation  
- **Prediction Page** ‚Äî Enter applicant details and get real-time predictions  
- **Interpretation & Conclusions** ‚Äî Compare DT vs NB with metrics and feature insights

## Models & Features
- **Decision Tree (DT):** `HasGoodCredit, TotalIncome, EMI, LoanAmount, Property_Area, IsMarried`  
- **Naive Bayes (NB):** `HasGoodCredit, TotalIncome, EMI, LoanAmount, Property_Area, IsMarried, Dependents`  

**Engineered Feature:**  
- **EMI** = LoanAmount √∑ Loan_Amount_Term (Equated Monthly Installment)  

---

## Results
- **Decision Tree:** More interpretable, highlights key drivers, flexible threshold adjustment.  
- **Naive Bayes:** Simpler, robust with preprocessing and one-hot encoding, competitive performance.  
- **Trade-offs:** DT provides clearer interpretability; NB works well with scaled data.
